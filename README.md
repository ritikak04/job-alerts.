# job-alerts

Pings my phone within ~30 min when a **new grad, internship, or analyst-program**
role in **finance, banking, consulting, or data/business analytics** drops at one
of my target companies.

end to end and explains how the filters were tuned for my resume.

      │                   recruiter, …) are dropped even if they matched
      │
      ├─ collapse ──────► one row per (company, title): a role listed on the

      │
      ├─ diff ──────────► against seen.json (committed back each run), so
      │                   each posting only ever notifies once
      │
      └─ notify ────────► POST to ntfy.sh/<topic> → phone push, tap to open
                          (past `max_pings` in one run, the rest collapse
                           into a single digest ping)
```

## Setup

1. **Install ntfy** on your phone (iOS App Store / Google Play / F-Droid).
2. **Subscribe to a private topic.** Pick something unguessable, e.g.
   `rish-jobs-8f3ka92mx`. Anyone who knows the topic can read it, so treat it
   like a password.
3. **Push this repo to GitHub** (private is fine, Actions works either way).
4. **Add the topic as a secret:** repo → Settings → Secrets and variables →
   Actions → New repository secret → name `NTFY_TOPIC`, value your topic name.
5. **Enable Actions** on the repo, then run the workflow once manually
   (Actions tab → job-alerts → Run workflow).

The first run **seeds** `seen.json` with everything currently open and sends a
single "Job alerts armed" ping instead of a flood. From then on you only hear
about genuinely new postings.

## Local use

```bash
python3 poll.py --verify   # probe every feed, print counts, notify nothing
NTFY_TOPIC=your-topic python3 poll.py   # real run
```

`--verify` is the one to run after editing `sources.json` — it shows which
companies resolve and which 404, without touching state or sending pushes.

## Adding companies

Add a row to `companies` in `sources.json`:

```json
{"name": "Cartesia", "ats": "ashby", "slug": "cartesia"}
```

`ats` is one of `greenhouse`, `lever`, `ashby`, `smartrecruiters`, `rippling`,
`workday`, `oracle`, `eightfold`, `amazon`, or `none`. Use `none` for a company with no
public ATS feed — the name still gets matched against the aggregator listings,
and `aliases` lets an aggregator's "Google" resolve to your "Google DeepMind".

The board-slug ones all take the same shape; the two parameterized ones need a
few more fields:

```json
{"name": "Salesforce", "ats": "workday", "slug": "", "tenant": "salesforce",
 "site": "External_Career_Site", "dc": "wd12", "queries": ["intern"], "max": 80}
{"name": "Netflix", "ats": "eightfold", "slug": "",
 "host": "explore.jobs.netflix.net", "domain": "netflix.com",
 "queries": ["intern", "new grad"], "max": 100}
{"name": "JPMorgan Chase", "ats": "oracle", "slug": "",
 "host": "jpmc.fa.oraclecloud.com", "site": "CX_1001",
 "queries": ["analyst", "intern"], "max": 100}
```

**Finding a Workday site name:** the tenant's `robots.txt` lists them. E.g.
`https://visa.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/robots.txt` names both `Visa` and
`Visa_Early_Careers`. A wrong site returns HTTP 404 and a wrong tenant/dc
returns HTTP 422, so both are quick to tell apart.

Listing a company **twice** — once for its main board, once for its campus /
early-careers board — is supported and encouraged. Duplicate roles collapse on
`(company, title)`, so it never doubles your pings.

`queries`/`max` exist because those boards are enormous — you search them
rather than pulling every posting.

**Finding a company's slug:** run `python3 discover.py "Company Name"`, which
probes every board-slug ATS in parallel and prints a paste-ready row. Or probe
by hand:

- Greenhouse — `https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/<slug>/jobs`
- Lever — `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/<slug>?mode=json`
- Ashby — `https://api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board/<slug>`
- SmartRecruiters — `https://api.smartrecruiters.com/v1/companies/<slug>/postings`
- Rippling — `https://api.rippling.com/platform/api/ats/v1/board/<slug>/jobs`

Then run `python3 poll.py --verify` to confirm it returns jobs.

⚠️ Slugs collide across companies — `ashby/cedar` is a mortgage startup, not
Cedar Health; `lever/neon` is a Brazilian bank, not Neon Postgres. Always eyeball
a couple of returned titles before committing a discovered slug.

## Extending to more big tech

Google, Apple, Microsoft and Meta each run a bespoke careers API (and Microsoft's
blocks non-browser clients), so they ride on the aggregator feeds instead of a
direct one. To add a direct feed, write an `adapter_<company>(co)` returning the
normalized posting dict (`id`, `company`, `title`, `url`, `location`) and
register it in `ADAPTERS`. Nothing else in the pipeline changes.

Many Fortune 500s are on Workday or Eightfold, which already have generic
adapters — you only need the tenant/site/dc (Workday) or host/domain
(Eightfold) from the careers-page URL, no new code.

## What counts as entry-level

Internships announce themselves in the title. New-grad roles frequently do not
— a third of the new-grad roles at target companies are titled plainly
"Software Engineer" or "Software Engineer I". So the level test is a
precedence chain, checked in order:

1. **An explicit level word wins outright** — `intern`, `new grad`,
   `early career`, `campus`, `graduate`, … Google really does post "Software
   Engineer II, Early Career" and Amazon "Applied Scientist 2 Intern"; a role
   that calls itself entry-level is one.
2. **Otherwise seniority vetoes** — `senior`, `staff`, `principal`, `manager`,
   … so Rocket Lab's "Senior Ground Software Engineer I" can't sneak in on the
   suffix. ("lead" is anchored to `tech lead`/`lead engineer`, because "Lead
   Ads" is a TikTok product, not a job level.)
3. **"Engineer I" / "Developer 1" counts on its own** — the most common
   new-grad title containing no new-grad word. Level II and up do not.
4. **A level-curated feed vouches for the rest.** The aggregator repos list
   nothing but new-grad and internship roles, so membership *is* the level
   signal (`"level_implied": true`). Without this the filter throws away ~470
   genuine new-grad roles whose titles simply don't say "new grad".

A separate veto drops roles that talk about engineering without being
engineering — "Campus Recruiter, Machine Learning" clears both keyword gates
otherwise.

Set `"level_implied": false` if you'd rather trust only the title.

## Tuning the filter

Edit `filters` in `sources.json`.

- Too noisy → tighten `role_keywords`, or drop broad ones like `2026`,
  `developer`, `junior`. Dropping a whole `"ats": "none"` company also helps:
  those match by name against every aggregator feed, so a big employer like
  TikTok contributes a lot of rows on its own.
- Wrong *kind* of role → add to `exclude_keywords`. It vetoes a title even when
  the role and level keywords both matched, which is how "Cyber Security Analyst
  Intern" gets dropped while "Sales & Trading Summer Analyst" is kept. Leave
  `exclude_keywords` out entirely and the built-in SWE-oriented veto applies
  instead.
- Missing roles → add title variants companies actually use.
- Too many pings at once → lower `max_pings` (default 10); everything past it
  arrives as one digest instead.
- Run slow → lower `max_workers` (default 12) if a host starts rate-limiting;
  raise it if you add another hundred companies.

Known tradeoff: matching is **title-only** for company feeds. A role on a
company's own board titled plain "Software Engineer" that is secretly
new-grad-friendly still won't match — nothing in the title says otherwise, and
matching on descriptions roughly triples false positives. The aggregator feeds
cover that gap for the companies they track, since their curation supplies the
level signal the title lacks.
